Hey, I am Anthony Fu.

Being part of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) core team, I am maintaining [@vue/composition-api](https://github.com/vuejs/composition-api), a plugin providing Composition API to Vue 2. You may also know me as a member of [wenyan-lang](https://wy-lang.org/) 文言, a programming language for the ancient Chinese. I help to build its ecosystem including the [VS Code Extension](https://github.com/antfu/wenyan-lang-vscode) and [Online IDE](https://ide.wy-lang.org/).

Dreaming up ideas and making them come true is where my passion lies. Check out my [projects list here](https://antfu.me/projects).

Outside of programming, I enjoy doing photography and traveling. I post my photos occasionally on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/antfu7).
