## Match Chinese Characters

_2020-02-25_

When you need to detect if a string contains Chinese characters, you would commonly think about doing it will RegExp, or grab a ready-to-use package on npm.

If you Google it, you are likely end up with [this solution](https://stackoverflow.com/a/21113538):

```ts
/[\u4E00-\u9FCC\u3400-\u4DB5\uFA0E\uFA0F\uFA11\uFA13\uFA14\uFA1F\uFA21\uFA23\uFA24\uFA27-\uFA29]|[\ud840-\ud868][\udc00-\udfff]|\ud869[\udc00-\uded6\udf00-\udfff]|[\ud86a-\ud86c][\udc00-\udfff]|\ud86d[\udc00-\udf34\udf40-\udfff]|\ud86e[\udc00-\udc1d]/
```

It works, but a bit dirty. Fortunately, I found [a much simpler solution](https://stackoverflow.com/a/61151122) today:

```ts
/\p{Script=Han}/u
```

```ts
!!'你好'.match(/\p{Script=Han}/u) // true
```
