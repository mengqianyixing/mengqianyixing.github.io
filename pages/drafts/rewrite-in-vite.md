The page you are looking at is now powered by [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite). This is something I want to do for a long while since Vite came out, and it's finally done. As I have mentioned in my [first blog post](https://antfu.me/posts/new-house), this site was powered [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/) using Vue 2. With this overhaul, I can now take the full advantage of Vue 3 and the [Composition API](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/composition-api-introduction.html) with the new [`<script setup>` SFC style](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/pull/227).

The reason for it taking me so long to do this is because I am busy (enjoy) doing yak shaving, for the tools I need to build this site.
